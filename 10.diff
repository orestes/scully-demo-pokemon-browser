+Angular demo project with static generation powered by [Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully)
 
-## Development server
+## Adding Scully to your project
 
-Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
-
-## Code scaffolding
-
-Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
+0. Read the [Scully documentation](https://github.com/scullyio/scully)
+0. Add Scully to your Angular CLI project with `ng add @scullyio/init`
+0. Run `yarn run scully` and verify your routes are being pre-rendered
+0. If needed, write [router plugins](https://github.com/scullyio/scully/blob/main/docs/plugins.md#router-plugin) for your dynamic routes (like `view/:id`)
+0. If not needed during runtime, remove Angular altogether from the resulting bundle by using [scully-plugin-disable-angular](https://samvloeberghs.be/posts/disabling-angular-when-statically-genering-with-scully). 
 
 ## Build
 
 Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
 
-## Running unit tests

-Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
+0. Run `yarn build:prod` to build the project with production settings.
+0. Run `yarn scully` to generate a static version of your site, with no Angular scripts included.
+0. Deploy `dist/static` to your http server. You can also run `yarn serve:static` to serve locally
